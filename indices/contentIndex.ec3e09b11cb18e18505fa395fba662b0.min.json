Every time you buy something you create a transaction.\n\nEach transaction consists of a buyer exchanging money or credit with a seller for goods, services or financial assets.\n\nSo adding together the money spent and the amount of credit spent, you can know the **total spending**. The total amount of spending drives the economy.\n\nIf you divide the amount spent by the quantity sold, you get the **price**. \nAnd that's it. That's a **[[transaction]]**.\n\n- All cycles and all forces in an economy are driven by transactions. So, if we can understand transactions, we can understand the whole economy.\n- A market consists of all the buyers and all the sellers making transactions for the same thing. For example, there is a wheat market, a car market, a stock market.\n- An economy consists of all of the transactions in all of its markets.\n\nThe biggest buyer and seller is the government, which consists of two important parts:\n\n- a Central Government that **collects taxes and spends money**;\n\n- Central Bank, which is different from other buyers and sellers because it **controls the amount of money and credit in the economy**. It does this by influencing interest rates and printing new money. the Central Bank is an important player in the flow of **[[Credit]]**.\n\n### 1.2 Credit\nJust like buyers and sellers go to the market to make transactions, so do lenders and borrowers.\n\nLenders usually want to make their money into more money and borrowers usually want to buy something they can't afford, like a house or car. \n\nBorrowers promise to repay the amount they borrow, called the principal, plus an additional amount, called **interest**. When interest rates are high, there is less borrowing because it's expensive. When borrowers promise to repay and lenders believe them, credit is created.\n\nAs soon as credit is created, it immediately turns into debt. Debt is both an asset to the lender, and a liability to the borrower.\n\n*So, why is credit so important?*\n\nBecause when a borrower receives credit, he is able to increase his spending. And remember, spending drives the economy. This is because one person's spending is another person's income. \n\nSo increased income allows increased borrowing (from the bank) which allows increased spending. And since one person's spending is another person's income, this leads to more increased borrowing and so on. This self-reinforcing pattern leads to economic growth and is why we have **Cycles**.\n\n\n## 2. Productivity growth\nThose who were invented and hard-working raise their productivity and their living standards faster than those who are complacent and lazy. BUT Productivity matters most in the long run, but **[[Credit]]** matters most in the **short run**.\n\nThis is because productivity growth doesn't fluctuate much (it is a linear function), so it's not a big driver of economic swings. **[[Debt]]** is(non linear function) ‚Äî because it allows us to consume more than we produce when we acquire it and it forces us to consume less than we produce when we pay it back.\n\nDebt swings occur in two big cycles:\n- One takes about 5 to 8 years;\n- The other takes about 75 to 100 years.\n\n\n*But How does these three big forces (**Productivity**, **Debt**, **Credit**) interact with each others?*\n\nThese non linear function that swings around the line are not due to how much **innovation** or hard work there is, they're primarily due to how much **credit** there is.\n\nLet's for a second imagine an economy without credit. In this economy, the only way I can increase my spending is to increase my income, which requires me to be more productive and do more work. Increased productivity is the only way for growth: **Linear**.\n\nBut because we borrow, we have cycles. This isn't due to any laws or regulation, it's due to human nature and the way that credit works.\n\nThink of borrowing as simply a way of **pulling spending forward**. In order to buy something you can't afford, you need to spend more than you make. To do this, you essentially need to borrow from your future self. In doing so you create a time in the future that you need to spend less than you make in order to pay it back. It very quickly resembles a **cycle**.\n\nThe reality is that most of what people call money is actually credit. The total amount of credit in the United States is about $50 trillion and the total amount of money is only about $3 trillion.\n\nAs a result, an economy with credit has more spending and allows incomes to rise faster than productivity over the short run, but not over the long run.\n\n**NB**: Now, don't get me wrong, credit isn't necessarily something bad that just causes cycles. For example, if you borrow money to buy a big TV, it doesn't generate income for you to pay back the debt. But, if you borrow money to buy a tractor ‚Äî and that tractor let's you harvest more crops and earn more money ‚Äî then, you can pay back your debt.\n\n## 3.The Short term debt cycle\nSuppose you earn $100,000 a year and have no debt. You are creditworthy enough to borrow $10,000 dollars, so you can spend $110,000 dollars even though you only earn $100,000 dollars. \n\nSince your spending is another person's income, someone is earning $110,000 dollars. The person earning $110,000 dollars with no debt can borrow $11,000 dollars, so he can spend $121,000 dollars even though he has only earned $110,000 dollars. His spending is another person's income, exc. A cycle is beginning.\n\nAnd if the cycle goes up, it eventually needs to come down. This leads us into the **Short Term Debt Cycle**.\n\n### 3.1 Inflation\nAs economic activity increases, we see an [[expansion]], the first phase of the short term debt cycle. Spending continues to increase and prices start to rise. When prices rise, we call this **[[Inflazione]]**.\n\nThe Central Bank doesn't want too much inflation because it causes problems. Seeing prices rise, it **raises interest rates**. With higher interest rates, fewer people can afford to borrow money.\n### 3.2 Deflation / Recession\nBecause people borrow less and have higher debt repayments, they have less money leftover to spend, so spending slows ...and since one person's spending is another person's income, incomes drop! \nWhen people spend less, prices go down. We call this **[[deflazione]]**.\n\nEconomic activity decreases and we have a [[recessione]]. \n\n### 3.3 ...and again Inflation\nIf the recession becomes too severe and inflation is no longer a problem, the central bank will **lower interest rates** to cause everything to pick up again.\n\nWith low interest rates, debt repayments are reduced and borrowing and spending pick up and we see another **[[expansion]]**.\n\nAnd note that this cycle is controlled primarily by the central bank. The short term debt cycle typically lasts 5 - 8 years and happens over and over again for decades. \n\n..But notice that the bottom and top of each cycle finish with more growth than the previous cycle and with more debt. \n\n*Why?*\nBecause people push it ‚Äî they have an inclination to borrow and spend more instead of paying back debt. It's human nature. Over long periods of time, debts rise faster than incomes creating the **Long Term Debt Cycle**.\n\n\n## 4.The Long term debt cycle\nDespite people becoming more indebted, lenders even more freely extend credit (that's strange, banks should be reclined to give credit to people that are in debt!). \n\nBut Why lenders do that? Because everybody thinks things are going great! They can see only the short term. Incomes have been rising! Asset values are going up! The stock market roars! It's a boom! When people do a lot of that, we call it a **bubble**.\n\nSo even though debts have been growing, incomes have been growing nearly as fast to offset them.\n\nPeople borrow huge amounts of money to buy assets as investments causing their prices to rise even higher. Over decades, debt burdens slowly increase creating larger and larger debt repayments. \n\nAt some point, **debt repayments start growing faster than incomes** forcing people to cut back on their spending. And since one person's spending is another person's income, incomes begin to go down...which makes people less creditworthy causing borrowing to go down. This is the **long term debt peak**.\n\n### 4.1 Short term VS Long term\n*But what is the difference between this situation and the short-term?*\nThis appears similar to a recession but the difference here in a [[Deleveraging]] is that **interest rates can't be lowered** to save the day.\n\nIn a [[Deleveraging]]; people cut spending, incomes fall, credit disappears, assets prices drop, banks get squeezed, the stock market crashes, social tensions rise. borrowers get squeezed. No longer creditworthy, and they can no longer borrow enough money to make their debt repayments. \n\nSo borrowers are forced to sell assets. The rush to sell assets floods the market. More people wanna sell so they prices go down.This is when the stock market collapses.\n\nIn a recession, lowering interest rates works to stimulate the borrowing. However, in a [[Deleveraging]], lowering interest rates doesn't work because interest rates are already low and soon hit 0% - so the stimulation ends.\n\nThe difference between a recession and a deleveraging is that in a deleveraging borrowers' debt burdens have simply gotten too big and can't be relieved by lowering interest rates.\n\n### 4.2 Possibile Solutions\n*So what do you do about a deleveraging?*\n\nThe problem is debt burdens are too high and they must come down. There are four ways this can happen:\n1. Austerity: People, businesses, and governments cut their spending.\n2. Debts are reduced through defaults and restructurings.\n3. Wealth is redistributed from the 'haves' to the 'have nots'.\n4. The central bank prints new money.\n\n### 4.3 Austerity\nUsually, spending is cut first. Because spending is cut, and one man's spending is another man's income - it causes incomes to fall. They fall faster than debts are repaid and the debt burden actually gets worse.\n\nThis cut in spending is deflationary and painful. Businesses are forced to cut costs... which means less jobs and higher unemployment.\n\n\n### 4.4 Reducing Debts\nMany borrowers find themselves unable to repay their loans -- and a borrower's debts are a lender's assets. When borrowers don't repay the bank, people get nervous that the bank won't be able to repay them so they rush to withdraw their money from the bank. Banks get squeezed.\n\nThis severe economic contraction is a **[[depression]]**.\n\n### 4.5 Welth is redistributed\nAll of this impacts the central government because lower incomes and less employment means the government **collects fewer taxes**. At the same time it needs to increase its spending because unemployment has risen.\n\nAdditionally, governments create stimulus plans and increase their spending to make up for the decrease in the economy.\n\nGovernments' budget **[[deficits]]** explode in a deleveraging because they spend more than they earn in taxes. This is what is happening when you hear about the budget **[[deficit]]** on the news.\n\nTo fund their deficits, governments need to either raise taxes or borrow money. But with incomes falling and so many unemployed, who is the money going to come from? The **rich**.\n\nSince governments need more money and since wealth is heavily concentrated in the hands of a small percentage of the people, governments naturally raise taxes on the wealthy which facilitates a redistribution of wealth in the economy. \n\nIf the depression continues social disorder can break out. This situation can lead to political change that can sometimes be extreme. In the 1930s, this led to Hitler coming to power.\n\n### 4.6 Printing money\n\nInevitably, the central bank prints new money ‚Äî out of thin air ‚Äî and uses it to buy financial assets and government bonds. In 2008, when the United States' central bank ‚Äî the Federal Reserve ‚Äî printed over two trillion dollars. **$5.2 trillion** in COVID.\n\nThe Central Government, on the other hand, can buy goods and services and put money in the hands of the people but it can't print money. So, in order to stimulate the economy, the two must cooperate.\n\nBy buying government bonds, the Central Bank essentially lends money to the government, allowing it to run a deficit and increase spending on goods and services through its stimulus programs and unemployment benefits.\n\n\nHowever, it will lower the economy's total debt burden. This is a very risky time. The deflationary ways need to balance with the inflationary ways in order to maintain stability. If balanced correctly, there can be a Beautiful Deleveraging.\n\n### 4.7 How a Deleveraging could be a good situation (more than leveraging)?\nEven though a deleveraging is a difficult situation, handling a difficult situation in the best possible way is beautiful. A lot more beautiful than the debt-fueled, unbalanced excesses of the leveraging phase. \n\nIn a beautiful deleveraging, debts decline relative to income, real economic growth is positive, and inflation isn't a problem. It is achieved by having the right balance.\n\nThe right balance requires a certain mix of:\n- cutting spending, \n- reducing debt, \n- transferring wealth\n- printing money \n\nThe Central Bank needs to not only pump up income growth but get the rate of income growth higher than the rate of interest on the accumulated debt. Basically, income needs to grow faster than debt grows.\n\nSo If policymakers achieve the right balance, a deleveraging isn't so dramatic. Growth is slow but debt burdens go down.\n\n### 4.8 [[Reflation]]\nWhen incomes begin to rise, borrowers begin to appear more creditworthy. And when borrowers appear more creditworthy, lenders begin to lend money again. Debt burdens finally begin to fall.\n\nAble to borrow money, people can spend more. Eventually, the economy begins to grow again, leading to the [[reflation]] phase of the long term debt cycle. It takes roughly a **decade** or more for debt burdens to fall and economic activity to get back to normal\n\n## 5.Conclusion\nLaying the short term debt cycle on top of the long term debt cycle and then laying both of them on top of the productivity growth line gives a reasonably good template for seeing where we've been, where we are now and where we are probably headed.\n\nSo in summary, there are three rules of thumb that I'd like you to take away from this:\n\n1. Don't have debt rise faster than income, because your debt burdens will eventually crush you.\n\n2. Don't have income rise faster than productivity, because you will eventually become uncompetitive.\n\n3. Do all that you can to raise your productivity, because, in the long run, that's what matters most.\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-08-27T10:00:32.798131943Z","tags":null},"/notes/Learning-Obsidian":{"title":"Learining Obsidian","content":"# [[Learning Obsidian]] ü¶ë\n```md\n*Questo testo sar√† in corsivo*\n_Anche questo testo sar√† in corsivo_\n```\n\n*Questo testo sar√† in corsivo*\n_Anche questo testo sar√† in corsivo_\n\n```md\n**Questo testo sar√† in grassetto**\n__Anche questo testo sar√† in grassetto__\n```\n\n**Questo testo sar√† in grassetto**\n__Anche questo testo sar√† in grassetto__\n\n```md\n_Si possono **combinare** insieme_\n```\n\n_Si possono **combinare** insieme_\n\n---\n\n### Elenchi\n\n```md\n- Elemento 1\n- Elemento 2\n  - Elemento 2a\n  - Elemento 2b\n\n1.

Breaking the link to gold allowed the US to speding more than it erned, simply by printing more paper dollars, and the value of each dollar fell. Without a corrispendence in productinity, all this money went to buy lots of stocks gold and commodities and causes their price to rise!!\nThe excact same things happend many many times before:\n- 2008: leeman Brother\n- 1971: Nixon\n- 1933: Roosvelt\n- 1850: UK\n- 1650: Netherlands\nWhen governament  spent much more than they took in in taxes and conditions got bad they ran out of money and they needed more so they printed more.\n\n**Principles**: when central banks print a lot of money to relieve a crisis buy stocks gold and commodities because their value will rise and the value of paper money will fall\n\n**Principles**: to understand what is coming at you you need to understand what happened before you\n###### 1.1 What is a Reserver Currency\nAfter WW2 dollar as the world's leading reserve currency a **reserve currency** is a currency that is commonly accepted around the world and having one is a key factor in a country becoming the richest and most powerful empire. And a new world order begins. This is what we define as a **Big Cicle**.\n### 2 Big Cicle\nIf we take the history data, they transpired in overlapping cycles that lasted about 250 years with 10 to 20 year transition periods between them:\n\n###### 2.1 All the cycle of a new World Order\nIn a nutshell the big cycle typically begins after a major conflict often a war establishes the new leading power and the new world order.\n\nBecause no one wants to challenge this power a period of peace and prosperity typically follows as people get used to this peace and prosperity they increasingly bet on it continuing they **borrow money** to do that which eventually leads to a financial bubble. \n\nWhen most transactions are conducted in its currency it becomes a **reserve currency** (peak of the curve). \n\nWhich leads to even more borrowing at the same time this increased prosperity distributes wealth unevenly so the **wealth gap typically grows** between rich and pour.\n\nEventually the financial bubble bursts which leads to the printing of money and increased internal conflict between the rich and the poor which leads to some form of revolution to redistribute well.\n\nWhen a new rising power gets strong enough to compete with the dominant power that is having domestic breakdowns external conflicts most typically wars take place.\n## 3 The three phase of a typical cycle\nLet's describe the typical cycle by dividing it into three phases the rise the top and the decline:\n###### 2.1 The rise\n- strong education: provides a healthy respect for rules and laws order within society low corruption and enables them to unite behind a common purpose and work well together\n- They do this they increasingly shift from producing basic products to innovating and inventing new technologies\n- as a result the people in the country become more productive and more competitive in world markets which shows up in their growing economic output and rising share of world trade\n- they develop great military strength\n-  leads to strong income growth which can be used to finance investments in education infrastructure and research and development they must also develop systems to incentivize and empower those that have the ability to make or take wealth\n- Because their currency is so widely accepted and frequently used people around the world want to save in it making it the preferred storehold of wealth and thus the world's leading **reserve currency**. having a reserve currency enables the empire to borrow more than other countries. \n- they can always print more the exorbitant privilege afforded by the empire's reserve currency leads borrowing to increase and the beginning of a **financial bubble**\n###### 2.1 The top\n- As a rule as people in these rich and powerful countries earn more that makes them more expensive and less competitive relative to people in other countries who are willing to work for less at the same time people in other countries naturally copy the methods and technologies of the leading power which further reduces the leading power's competitiveness;\n- people get used to doing well they increasingly bet on the good times continuing and borrow money to do that which grows into financial bubbles\n- naturally the financial gains come unevenly so the **wealth gap grows**. wealth gaps are self-reinforcing because rich people use their greater resourcesto reinforce their powers for example they give greater privileges to their children like better education and they influence the political system to their advantage. as long as the living standards of most people are still rising these gaps and resentments don't boil over into conflict;\n- having the world's reserve currency inevitably leads to **borrowing excessively** ,**building up large debts** with foreign lenders while this boosts spending power over the short term. it weakens the country's financial health and **weakens** the currency over the long term.\n- In this cycle the richer countries eventually get deeper into debt by borrowing from poorer countries that save more it's one of the early signs of a wealth and powershift. this started in the united states in the 1980s when it had a per capita income 40 times that of china's and started borrowing from chinese who wanted to save in dollars\n###### 2.1 The decline\nthe decline comes from internal economic weakness together with internal fighting or costly external fighting or both:\n- when debts become very large and there is an economic downturn and the empire can no longer borrow the money necessary to repay its debts the **financial bubble** bursts\n- this forces the country to choose between defaulting on its debts or printing a lot of new money\n- that devalues the currency and raises inflation\n- when there are bad economic conditions and living standards for most people are declining and there are large wealth values and political gaps internal conflict between the rich and the poor.  this leads to political extremism that shows up as populism of the left or the right\n- when the move to a strong populous leader who will bring order to the chaos is most likely as conflict within the country escalates it leads to some form of revolution or civil war to redistribute wealth\n- this internal conflict makes the empire weak and vulnerable to rising external rivals who seeing this domestic weakness are more inclined to mount a challeng this raises the risk of great international conflict especially if the rival has built up a comparable military\n- wars are terribly costly at the same time they produce the tectonic shifts that realign the new waters to the new realities of wealth and power in the world\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-08-27T10:00:32.798131943Z","tags":null},"/notes/Writing-in-Markdown":{"title":"","content":"# 6 keys to write like a PRO ü¶ë\n- The link. of the cheat sheet:
