# Hi, there👋. My name is Mattia Ippoliti

Hello there, traveller of the web. Welcome back! You must be tired from your journey.

Come, sit! Welcome to my little garden on the internet – I’m Mattia! I spend a lot of time here playing, writing, and building out in the open. It’s a little unkempt in places, but I think it gives it a little charm.

## Who am I?
I’m curious about how we can better incentivize public goods funding, support better interactions with computers and data, and be more responsible stewards of technology.
In this era of my life, I’m working towards being someone who is unabashedly excited and curious about the world.
