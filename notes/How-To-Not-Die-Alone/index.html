Three dating tendencies and the idea is that all of us fit into one of these categories but we probably have traits from all three of the categories:</p><ol><li>the first type of dating tendency is the <strong>romanticizer</strong> this is the sort of person who kind of believes the whole soulmate stuff (Mmmh yeah but not so much);</li><li>Hesitator now this is the sort of person that thinks you know what i am not ready for dating just yet (But I am);</li><li>Maximizer they&rsquo;re looking out for and find the person who most maximize sort of hits the highest score point (That&rsquo;s it!);</li></ol><a href=#3dont-let-perfect-be-the-enemy-of-great><h4 id=3dont-let-perfect-be-the-enemy-of-great><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>3.Don&rsquo;t-let-perfect-be-the-enemy-of-great</h4></a><p>We should be trying to do is become instead of a maximizer a satisficer and the idea here is that instead of trying to maximize trying to find the absolute perfect person you possibly can you we should try and find someone who is like good enough and then work to make that relationship something that is absolutely fantastic.</p><p>If we look at the studies, the thing we&rsquo;re optimizing for is not can we find the perfect partner because there&rsquo;s no such thing as a perfect partner!
The thing we&rsquo;re trying to optimize for is what is going to lead to long-term happiness in our relationship and it turns out that even if you are a maximizer AND if you find the perfect person, the fact that you&rsquo;re a maximizer and you&rsquo;re approaching this with a maximizing kind of point of view means <strong>you&rsquo;re going to be less happy in that relationship than someone who is a satisficer</strong>.</p><p>Being a satisfier rather than a maximizer is one part of the equation but it&rsquo;s not the only part of the equation and the next thing is to actually figure out what sort of person we&rsquo;re looking.</p><a href=#4-stop-looking-for-prom-dates><h4 id=4-stop-looking-for-prom-dates><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>4. Stop looking for prom dates</h4></a><p>Present bias and that is the feeling that causes us to prioritize the short term over what actually matters in the long term this is the reason why we procrastinate from all sorts of things in life.</p><p>Looking for a prom date rather than looking for a life partner a prom date as she says is someone who looks great in pictures someone is really good looking someone who makes us feel amazing.</p><p>Most important trades when choosing a person:</p><ol><li>Emotionally stable and kind;</li><li>Growth mindset relative to the fixed mindset. Someone with a growth mindset is more likely to want to work together to overcome those problems because they believe they can grow into;</li><li>we want to try and find someone who can <strong>fight well</strong>. not let their kind of emotions get like override kind of the way that they&rsquo;re approaching the conversation;</li></ol><a href=#4-spread-your-wings><h4 id=4-spread-your-wings><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>4. Spread your wings</h4></a><p>Three important <strong>cardinal rules</strong> to keep in mind rule:</p><ol><li>number one is that we don&rsquo;t actually know what we want. things that we think we want do not correlate to the things that actually bring us long-term happiness</li><li>The <em>spark</em> is b.s. : it was love at first sight oh i really felt a really strong spark when we first met. Apparently that&rsquo;s all bs.
One study that she cites in the book uh that looked at 400 happily married like long-term successful relationship couples and found that only 11 of them fell to that feeling of love at first sight. that spark is not enough to sustain things, instead focus on more on long term life partnery qualities <a href=/article#ac5d25 rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/article>See 3.</a></li><li>Always go on a second date. we&rsquo;re just not compatible because we had those three seconds of silence.</li><li><strong>Fundamental attribution</strong> error where we um attribute a behavior that someone has exhibited to a personality. for example if someone is five minutes date late to a date we will do the fundamental attribution error and think oh this this is the sort of person who just doesn&rsquo;t respect people&rsquo;s time</li></ol><a href=#5decidedont-slide><h4 id=5decidedont-slide><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>5.Decide,don&rsquo;t-slide</h4></a><p>We&rsquo;ve been dating for a few months maybe a few years now maybe the pandemic is coming up why don&rsquo;t we just move in together these are all like sliding type things.</p><p>You want to actively decide these very big things you want to sit down with your partner and draw up a pros and cons list and like really really actively talk about what could go wrong what what the expectations what are we hoping for from this.</p><p>Really actively think about what you want from the relationship what they want from the relationship communicating expectations.</p><a href=#bonus><h4 id=bonus><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Bonus</h4></a><a href=#self-acceptance><h6 id=self-acceptance><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span><a class="internal-link broken">Self-Acceptance</a></h6></a><ol><li>Practise relaxed awareness. this is about meditating and recognising and just sort of generally being more aware of our own thoughts. To practise, the idea is that you close your eyes for a minute and instead of pushing thoughts away for trying to focus on your breath, just softly notice your thoughts and feelings and body.
You might see negative thoughts or emotions, that&rsquo;s totally okay. Just notice them, watch them. Don&rsquo;t try to turn them into positive thoughts or push them away.</li><li>Rating yourself.</li><li>Practise gratitude. Writing down a few things you&rsquo;re grateful for each day, that does as much to increase our happiness as doubling our salary.</li><li>Forgiveness and compassion. If we judge ourselves for not doing well at something or not being good enough at something, can we forgive ourselves for this just as we might forgive someone else. We would recognise that we&rsquo;re all human. Humans are all imperfect.</li></ol><a href=#7tim-urban><h4 id=7tim-urban><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>7.Tim-Urban</h4></a><blockquote><p>Marriage is Forgettable Wednesday. Together.</p></blockquote><p>So I‚Äôll leave the butterflies and the kisses in the rain and the twice-a-day sex to you and spend this post trying to figure out the best way to <strong>make Forgettable Wednesday</strong> as happy as possible.</p><p>To endure 20,000 days with another human being and do so happily, there are three key ingredients necessary:</p><p><strong>1) An Epic Friendship</strong>
I enjoy spending time with most of my friends‚Äîthat‚Äôs why they‚Äôre my friends. But with certain friends, the time is so high-quality, so interesting, and so fun that they pass the Traffic Test. To me, almost nothing is more critical in choosing a life partner than finding someone who passes the Traffic Test. When there are people in your life who do pass the Traffic Test, what a whopping shame it would be to spend 95% of the rest of your life with someone who doesn‚Äôt.</p><p>A Traffic Test-passing friendship entails:</p><ul><li><strong>A great sense of humor click</strong>. No one wants to spend 50 years fake laughing.</li><li><strong>Fun.</strong> And the ability to extract fun out of unfun situations‚Äîairport delays, long drives, errands. Not surprisingly, studies suggest that the amount of fun a couple has is a strong predictor for their future.6</li><li><strong>A respect for each other‚Äôs brains and way of thinking.</strong> A life partner doubles as a career/life therapist, and if you don‚Äôt respect the way someone thinks, you‚Äôre not going to want to tell them your thoughts on work each day, or on anything else interesting that pops into your head, because you won‚Äôt really care that much what they have to say about it.</li><li><strong>A decent number of common interests, activities, and people-preferences.</strong> Otherwise a lot of what makes you ‚Äòyou‚Äô will inevitably become a much smaller part of your life, and you and your life partner will struggle to find enjoyable ways to spend a free Saturday together.</li></ul><p><strong>2) A Feeling of Home</strong></p><p>If someone told you you had to sit in a chair for 12 straight hours without moving, aside from wondering why the hell they were making you do this, your first thought would be, ‚ÄúI better get in the most comfortable possible position‚Äù‚Äîbecause you‚Äôd know that even the <em>slightest</em> bit of discomfort would grow to pain and eventually, torture. When you have to do something for a long, <em>long</em> time, it‚Äôs best if it‚Äôs <em>supremely</em> comfortable.</p><p>Feeling ‚Äúat home‚Äù means feeling safe, cozy, natural, and utterly yourself, and in order to have this feeling with a partner, a few things need to be in place:</p><ul><li><strong>Trust and security.</strong> <em>Secrets are poison to a relationship</em>, because they form an invisible wall inside the relationship, leaving both people somewhat alone in the world‚Äîand besides, who wants to spend 50 years lying or worrying about hiding something?</li><li><strong>Natural chemistry.</strong> Interacting should be easy and natural, <em>you should feel on the same ‚Äúwavelength‚Äù</em> in general. When I‚Äôm with someone on a very different wavelength than I am, it doesn‚Äôt take long before the interaction becomes exhausting.</li><li><strong>Acceptance of human flaws.</strong> You‚Äôre flawed ==imperfetto==. Like, really flawed. And so is your current or future life-partner. Being flawed is part of the definition of being a human. This isn‚Äôt to say people shouldn‚Äôt work on self-improvement, but when it comes to a life partnership, the healthy attitude is, ‚ÄúEvery person comes with a set of flaws, these are my partner‚Äôs, and they‚Äôre part of the package I knowingly chose to spend my life with.‚Äù</li><li><strong>A generally positive vibe.</strong> Remember, this is <em>the</em> vibe you‚Äôre a part of now, forever. It‚Äôs not really acceptable for it to be a negative one, nor is it sustainable.
<strong>3) A Determination to be Good at Marriage</strong></li></ul><p>Relationships are <em>hard.</em> Expecting a strong relationship without treating it like a rigorous part-time job is like expecting to have a great career without putting in any effort.</p><p><em>So what skills does someone need to learn to be good at marriage?</em></p><ul><li><strong>Communication.</strong> Communication being on this list is as silly as <strong>‚Äúoxygen‚Äù</strong> being on a list of items you need to stay healthy. And yet, poor communication is the downfall of a huge number of couples Communication is hard to do well consistently‚Äîsuccessful couples often need to create pre-planned systems.</li><li><strong>Maintaining equality.</strong> Relationships can slip into an unequal power dynamic pretty quickly. When <em>one person‚Äôs mood always dictates the mood in the room</em>, when <em>one person‚Äôs needs or opinion consistently prevail over the other‚Äôs</em>, when one person can treat the other in a way they‚Äôd never stand for being treated themselves‚Äîyou‚Äôve got a problem.</li><li><strong>Fighting well.</strong> Fighting is inevitable. But there are good and bad ways to fight. When a couple is good at fighting, they defuse tension, approach things with humor, and genuinely listen to the other side, while <em>avoiding getting nasty, personal or defensive</em>. They also fight less often than a bad couple.
