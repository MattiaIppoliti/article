# Hi, there👋. My name is Mattia Ippoliti

Hello there, traveller of the web. Welcome back! You must be tired from your journey.

Come, sit! Welcome to my little garden on the internet – I’m Mattia! I spend a lot of time here playing, writing, and building out in the open. It’s a little unkempt in places, but I think it gives it a little charm.

I am a **software engineer**, deeply interested in helping people interface more easily with their computers to get done the things that matter to them. I’m passionate about solving real problems, not building unnecessary technology.

I have almost 2 years of experience: first as a Software Engineer Intern from A*STAR Singapore, then later as a Junior Data Engineer in the banking industry, and currently as a Data Engineer for the same company where I am working right now.  In my spare time, I create and maintain a number of widely used open-source projects.

I’m curious about how we can better incentivize public goods funding, support better interactions with computers and data, and be more responsible stewards of technology.

In this era of my life, I’m working towards being someone who is unabashedly excited and curious about the world.
